# History versions

- The 1st release is based on Beego
- The 2nd release is based on Laravel

These two pre-releases are the designed too complex , and written when I was not so familar with web development. So these are just releases at my first attempt.
And now , I will bring the 3rd release which is very simple ,and it is written with KISS in mind.
Let's go!
